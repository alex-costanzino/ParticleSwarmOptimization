# Particle Swarm Optimization
A simple implementation of 'Particle swarm optimization' algorithm with plain python and some applications. A brief presentation is attached.

## P0 - Optimization of several test functions
Some non-convex, complex, with many local-optima functions, to test the efficiency of the algorithm.
The function are pre-tuned, you can just call the function and see what happens or change the hyperparameters to enhance the results.

## P1 - Design of a speed reducer
Constrained optimization problem (7 variables, 11 constraints) with penalty functions method. More details in the *.py file. 

## P2 - Design of a spring
Constrained optimization problem (3 variables, 4 constraints) with penalty functions method. More details in the *.py file.
